# Introduction
Hangman is a fun word guessing game where 2 or more players have to guess a word letter by letter until all their chances are over. I have worked on a code for single player Hangman. There are 6 words in a 2 dimensional array. A random index number is generated using a function and the word corresponding to that index number needs to be guessed.
# SWOT ANALYSIS
## STRENGTHS
Very user friendly, simple and readable. Very easy to understand and implement. Very fun to play.
## WEAKNESSES
Single player. Has a defined set of 6 words only which can be guessed by the player. Not very complex. 
## OPORTUNITIES
The number of words can be increased if required. The number of guessing chances can also be increased.
## THREATS
Might not be very entertaining sometimes since it does not have the animations.
