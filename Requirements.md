# Introduction
Hangman is a fun word guessing game where 2 or more players have to guess a word letter by letter until all their chances are over. I have worked on a code for single player Hangman. There are 6 words in a 2 dimensional array. A random index number is generated using a function and the word corresponding to that index number needs to be guessed.
# SWOT ANALYSIS

Single player. Has a defined set of 6 words only which can be guessed by the player. Not very complex.

The number of words can be increased if required. The number of guessing chances can also be increased.

Might not be very entertaining sometimes since it does not have the animations.
