# Introduction
Hangman is a fun word guessing game where 2 or more players have to guess a word letter by letter until all their chances are over. I have worked on a code for single player Hangman. There are 6 words in a 2 dimensional array. A random index number is generated using a function and the word corresponding to that index number needs to be guessed.
